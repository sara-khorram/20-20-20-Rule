# 20-20-20 Rule

The 20-20-20 rule is a technique designed to reduce eye strain and fatigue from screen use. It involves taking a break every 20 minutes to look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This Python script serves as a reminder to practice the 20-20-20 rule by displaying a picture that is personally meaningful to youâ€”whether it's a scenic view, a photo of your family, your pet, or anything else that brings you joy :)
